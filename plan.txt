how a connection between peers is established
- A obtains B's authentic onion address (public key)
- A enters B's onion address on their client, giving B a personal nickname
- A connects to B's onion address, establishing stream P (primary)
- A is certain that they are talking to B because only B would have the private key capable of responding to A's rendezvous message from the tor hidden service protocol (https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/672/how-do-onion-addresses-exactly-work)
- A sends their own onion address through P
- B does not know who just connected, but they can verify the onion address
- B's client prompts for A's onion address so that it can check that this is indeed A
- B creates a random cookie C and random self-id D
- B sends D through P
- B connects to A's onion address, establishing temporary authentication stream Q
- B sends C,D through Q to A
- A knows that it is B that just connected because A had previously received D through P
- A sends C through P
- B has verified A's onion address
- Q is closed and authenticated communication continues on P
- if A and B know each other somehow else and can communicate through a different secret channel, B can authenticate this address with A
